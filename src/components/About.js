        <h2>Matt Miguel</h2>
        <h5>My name is Matt Miguel, and I am a software developer with experience in Customer Service and Home Pricing based in Seattle, WA. My job and life experience has taught me to never underestimate the ability of a team working together to achieve the same goal. That’s what brought me to programming, the collaborative work involved to develop a meaningful product. I studied hospitality and have held customer facing roles for most of my career. I made the shift to home pricing, working closely with data analytics and machine learning, in early 2020 to better flex my skills as an analytical person. I was most recently a Pricing Analyst in the acquisitions team for Zillow Group but have made the transition to Code Fellows fulltime. During my spare time I like to snowboard, cook meals for others, as well as spend time with my wife and 2 dogs. My goal is to become a full stack developer with a tight knit team where I can use my customer centric aptitudes to help better their online experience and general accessibly.</h5>
     
        <h2>Chris Harden</h2>
        <h5>I’m Chris Harden and currently a student at CodeFellows, learning full stack development with a focus on JavaScript. I have almost a decade of professional tech experience. I first began working on computer systems and radios while serving in the Marines for 5 years. My next tech role was for a Fortune 100 gas & oil company, performing as an Infrastructure Specialist. This transition to code development will help me into an ever-growing career with limitless possibilities.</h5>

        <h2>Beau Hibbert</h2>
        <h5>Hello, my name is Beau Hibbert and I attended Washington State University to study economics and eventually got a job in the banking industry. After working for a couple of years, I came to the conclusion that the banking industry was not the right fit for me and decided that being a software engineer would be a smart move as it's one of the fastest growing industries. I really enjoy doing research and applying that newfound knowledge to increase performance in myself and others. With my background in economics and now software engineering, I am looking towards finding a role where I can continue to develop my skills and solve complex problems.</h5>
